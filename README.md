# Estrous_Cycle_Classification_by_Object_Detection_Using_YOLOv8
 Our project introduces leveraging Ultralytics's YOLOv8, for classification of the estrous cycle stages in mice. By employing object detection techniques, we address the limitations of traditional vaginal cytology methods, providing a faster, standardized, and more generalizable approach.
